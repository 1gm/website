My name is George Mokbel, I'm a freelance programmer from Southern California.  

Sometimes I post code related things on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/1gm).  

I'm an acoustic guitar player, singer, and songwriter. You can find some of my work on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/GeorgeGoesAcoustic).
